Our mission is to create a community that is a respite and safe harbour to all queer community members of YorkU and Seneca@York; where we can rest from the pressures often placed on us. This is impossible to do if you are spending a significant amount of your time dealing with unwelcome behavior.

Accordingly, by being a part of the TBLGAY community, you are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether in our Discord community, our drop-in space, or in other contexts.

To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of “show respect and courtesy to each other,” we have adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by the TBLGAY Internal & Collective team, members of which have orange or red usernames and are displayed at the top of the member list in the TBLGAY Discord server.
