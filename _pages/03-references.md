These rules are largely based on the Society for Internet Blaseball Research’s [Code Of Conduct](https://rules.sibr.dev), which are themselves based on[Recurse Center’s code of conduct](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct) and [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules), which in turn are based on the [!!Con Code of Conduct](http://bangbangcon.com/conduct.html), the [PyCon 2013 Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/), and the [example conference anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) on the Geek Feminism Wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. They are also partially based on the [Metafilter Content Policy](https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi).
